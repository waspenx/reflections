How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: logically clear
Cons: Prone to human mistakes, such as forgetting to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because, Git handles files of kinds that require multiple files for single feature/function, therefore needs to commit changes through multiple files together. Google Docs handles documents that are independent to each other therefore can commit each one by itself.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to see the history of commits with their id's, authors, date, and message.
Use git diff <id #1> <id #2> to compare two commits and see the changes.
