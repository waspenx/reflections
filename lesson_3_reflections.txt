Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I would like to share my repository with other people, or make a copy onto another computer, I would like to use the remote repository.
Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because you may have started making changes to local repository, pull will overwrite the changes on the local repository.
Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: So next time if merge is needed, the conflict will be noticed. Also if the local repository includes the state then a fast-forward merge is possible.
